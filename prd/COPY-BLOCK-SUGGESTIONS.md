# Approved copy blocks (homepage)

Locked per founder decisions. Use as-is for implementation; tweak only with founder sign-off.

## R1: Customer archetype (hero)

**Hero archetype:** Founders with a content team that’s not well versed in newsletters, or founders who write their own content and need a dedicated newsletter engine.

**Recommended copy (badge/pill or subhead):**

- **Short:** `Built for founders whose content team isn’t newsletter-savvy — or who write their own content and need a dedicated newsletter engine.`
- **Alternative:** `For founders with a content team that’s not versed in newsletters, or who write their own content and need a newsletter that scales.`

**Placement:** Hero badge (current “Newsletter Studio for AI startups…” slot) or directly under the main H1.

## R3: “We plug in; we don’t replace” (both objections)

**Headline:**  
`We plug in. You don’t replace anyone.`

**Body:**  
`Already have a content team? We act as your newsletter specialist — they stay, we add leverage. Solo or write your own content? We add the newsletter engine so you’re not starting from zero. No one gets replaced; you’re adding focused capacity.`

**Optional bullets:**
- Works alongside your existing content and marketing teams — or as your dedicated newsletter partner
- No org restructure required
- Newsletter strategy, production, growth, and repurposing — we own it so you can focus on product

**Placement:** New section after hero (or after “Why a newsletter”); visible in first scroll on mobile.

## R5: Founder + This Week in AI credential

**Credential line (hero or strip under hero):**  
`From the team behind This Week in AI`  
Link: https://thisweekinaiclub.substack.com

**Founder block:**
- **Name:** Hardeep Singh Mehra
- **Title:** Founder of This Week in AI
- **Bio line:** Founder of This Week in AI. Runs Flagbearer as the sister studio for newsletter strategy, production, and growth.
- **Links:** LinkedIn (https://linkedin.com/in/iamhasime), X (https://x.com/hsm4ai)
- **Headshot:** Optional — add if asset provided; otherwise name + title + links only.
- **Read more:** Link to `/about` if we expand bio there.

**Placement (best practice):** Strip under hero: “From the team behind [This Week in AI]” + founder name, title, and social links. Optionally repeat TWIA in the hero badge (e.g. “From the team behind This Week in AI • Newsletter studio for AI founders”).

## R4: Pricing anchor

**Pricing:** $1,000–$2,500/month depending on niche and need for external talent.  
**Commitment:** Minimum 3 months engagement to see results.

**Recommended copy (near CTA):**

- **Single line:** `Engagements run $1,000–$2,500/month depending on niche and scope; minimum 3-month engagement to see results.`
- **Short:** `Typically $1K–$2.5K/month. Minimum 3 months.`
- **With qualifier:** `Most engagements are $1,000–$2,500/month (niche and external talent vary). We ask for a minimum 3-month commitment so we can show results.`

**Placement:** Hero (under CTA) and/or final CTA strip (“Ready to see if we’re a fit?”).

---

## R2: Social proof (outcomes only — no revenue/sales)

**Allowed:** Subscriber growth, original research, content repurposing.  
**Not allowed:** Revenue or sales attribution.

**Flagship case — This Week in AI:**
- **Outcome:** Grew from 0 to 25,000 subscribers in 1 year. Global audience of business owners.
- **Link:** https://thisweekinaiclub.substack.com
- **Suggested card copy:** `This Week in AI: 0 to 25K subscribers in 12 months. Built for a global audience of business owners. We run the strategy, production, and growth — original research, repurposed across content marketing.`

**Promise we can state:**  
`We deliver newsletters with original research you can repurpose for content marketing — not vanity metrics.`

**Placement:** New “Results” or “Proof” section (e.g. after “Why a newsletter”); one card for TWIA; optional 1–2 more outcome cards later (growth/research/repurposing only, no revenue/sales).
