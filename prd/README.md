# PRD: Homepage conversion and positioning improvements

**Status:** Locked — decisions recorded below  
**Owner:** Product  
**Source:** Founder + 2 customer discovery calls  
**Last updated:** 2026-02

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Goal

Improve homepage conversion and qualification by making the value proposition, credibility, and fit unmistakable for the target customer — without a full redesign. Changes should be copy- and section-led, reuse existing design system, and be implementable in small, shippable increments.

### 1.2 Success (how we’ll know it worked)

- **Qualification:** Visitors can self-qualify (archetype + pricing anchor) and feel “this is for people like me” or “not for me” quickly.
- **Objection handling:** The “we’re not replacing your team” message is visible above the fold or in the first scroll, reducing bounce from that objection.
- **Trust:** Credibility (founder + This Week in AI) is visible early; social proof speaks in outcomes, not vanity metrics.
- **Intent:** “Book a call” / “Work with us” feels lower-risk because expectations (who it’s for, what it costs, who’s behind it) are clear.

## 2. Problem summary (founder + customer notes)

| # | Feedback | Implied need |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | No sharp, named customer archetype | One clear “built for X in situation Y” line so visitors lean in or self-select out |
| 2 | Social proof is metrics, not outcomes | Case studies with verifiable outcomes (e.g. pilots, press, revenue) instead of open rates |
| 3 | “Already have a content team?” not addressed | Explicit “we plug in as newsletter specialist; you’re adding leverage, not replacing anyone” |
| 4 | No pricing anchor | A range or “starts at $X/month” so visitors can self-qualify and CTA feels less risky |
| 5 | Founder/operator and TWIA credential buried | Visible face + “sister company of This Week in AI” above the fold or early scroll |

---

## 3. Requirements and implementation plan

### 3.1 R1: Named customer archetype

**Requirement:** Add a sharp “built for” statement. **Hero archetype:** Founders with a content team that’s not well versed in newsletters, or founders who write their own content and need a dedicated newsletter engine.

**Placement (suggested):** Hero or just below hero (badge/pill or subhead).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] One clear sentence that names who it’s for (founder + content team not newsletter-savvy, or founder who writes own content).
- [ ] Copy approved by founder; tone matches brand (conviction, not hype).
- [ ] No generic “startups” or “B2B” without the situational hook.

**Locked:** Hero = founder with content team (not versed in subject) or someone who writes their own content. No wording constraints (Q2: No).

---

### 3.2 R2: Social proof with outcomes (not vanity metrics)

**Requirement:** Use outcome-led social proof. **Allowed:** Growth (subscribers), quality (original research), content repurposing. **Not allowed:** Revenue or sales attribution. **Promise we can make:** Newsletters with original research for content marketing repurposing.

**Flagship case:** This Week in AI — 0 to 25K subscribers in 1 year; global business owners. Link: https://thisweekinaiclub.substack.com.

**Placement (suggested):** Dedicated “Results” or “Outcomes” section (cards or short case blurbs), after “Why a newsletter” and before or after “How it works.”

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] At least one proof point: TWIA 0→25K in 1 year, global audience (with link).
- [ ] No revenue or sales claims; focus on growth, original research, repurposing.
- [ ] Founder sign-off on copy (Q4: Me).

**Locked:** Q3 = TWIA as real case. Q4 = Founder. Q5 = No revenue/sales; only original research + content marketing repurposing.

---

### 3.3 R3: “We plug in; we don’t replace” section

**Requirement:** Address both objections: (1) “I already have a content team — will you replace them?” and (2) “I’m a solo founder / I write my own content — do I need a full team?” One section that covers both: we plug in as newsletter specialist; you add leverage, don’t replace anyone; works for teams and solos.

**Placement (suggested):** Early in the page (after hero or after “Why newsletter”) so it’s visible before the first CTA.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Message visible without scrolling past the fold (or within first scroll on mobile).
- [ ] Copy 1–3 sentences + optional bullets; addresses “have a team” and “solo / write own content.”
- [ ] Tone reassuring and specific.

**Locked:** Q6 = Both objections.

---

### 3.4 R4: Pricing anchor

**Requirement:** State range and commitment. **Pricing:** $1,000–$2,500/month depending on niche and need for external talent. **Commitment:** Minimum 3 months engagement to see results.

**Placement (suggested):** Near primary CTA (hero and/or final CTA strip) or “What to expect” callout.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Range $1,000–$2,500/month and “depending on niche and external talent” (or approved variant).
- [ ] Minimum 3 months engagement stated.
- [ ] Founder sign-off (Q9: Me).

**Locked:** Q7 = $1K–$2.5K/month. Q8 = Min 3 months. Q9 = Founder.

---

### 3.5 R5: Visible founder/operator and TWIA credential

**Requirement:** Surface founder and TWIA in hero or first scroll. **Founder:** Hardeep Singh Mehra, Founder of This Week in AI. Links: LinkedIn (https://linkedin.com/in/iamhasime), X (https://x.com/hsm4ai). Headshot optional. **TWIA:** No approval needed from TWIA to use name/link (Q12: No). Placement per best practices (Q11: PM call — recommend hero strip or badge).

**Placement (suggested):** Hero badge or strip under hero: “From the team behind This Week in AI” + founder name, title, and links.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] “Sister company of This Week in AI” or “From the team behind This Week in AI” in hero or first scroll; link to https://thisweekinaiclub.substack.com.
- [ ] Hardeep Singh Mehra, Founder of This Week in AI, with LinkedIn and X links.
- [ ] Optional headshot; link to About for more.

**Locked:** Q10 = Hardeep Singh Mehra, Founder of This Week in AI; links above. Q11 = Best practices. Q12 = No TWIA approval needed.

## 4. Phasing (recommended)

| Phase | Scope | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **P1** | R1 (archetype) + R3 (plug-in section) + R5 (founder/TWIA) | Copy- and placement-only; no new assets. Fast win, addresses “who is this for,” “will you replace my team,” and “who are you.” |
| **P2** | R4 (pricing anchor) | One number or range; needs commercial sign-off. |
| **P3** | R2 (outcomes-based social proof) | May need case write-ups, permissions, and possibly design for cards; can ship 1–2 outcomes first and add more over time. |
