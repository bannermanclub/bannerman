# Implementation checklist: Homepage (P1 → P3)

Use this list to implement the PRD. Check off as you ship. Copy comes from **COPY-BLOCK-SUGGESTIONS.md**.

---

## P1: Archetype + “Plug in” + Founder/TWIA

### R1 — Customer archetype
- [ ] Replace or update hero badge/pill with approved archetype copy (founders with content team not newsletter-savvy, or who write their own content).
- [ ] Ensure it appears above the fold on desktop and within first screen on mobile.
- [ ] Match existing design system (e.g. `badge-soft` or equivalent).

### R3 — “We plug in; we don’t replace”
- [ ] Add new section after hero (or after “Why a newsletter” block).
- [ ] Headline: “We plug in. You don’t replace anyone.”
- [ ] Body: approved 2–3 sentences covering (1) have a content team → we add leverage, (2) solo / write own content → we add the newsletter engine.
- [ ] Optional: 3 bullets (works alongside team or as partner; no restructure; we own strategy/production/repurposing).
- [ ] Section visible in first scroll on mobile.

### R5 — Founder + TWIA credential
- [ ] Add “From the team behind This Week in AI” with link to https://thisweekinaiclub.substack.com — in hero strip or badge (per best practice).
- [ ] Add founder block: **Hardeep Singh Mehra**, Founder of This Week in AI.
- [ ] Include LinkedIn (https://linkedin.com/in/iamhasime) and X (https://x.com/hsm4ai).
- [ ] Optional: headshot if asset provided; otherwise name + title + links.
- [ ] Optional: “Read more” → `/about`.
- [ ] Ensure this block is in hero or first scroll (not only footer). Reduce or keep footer TWIA mention as secondary.

---

## P2: Pricing anchor

### R4 — Pricing and commitment
- [ ] Add pricing line near primary CTA (hero): e.g. “Typically $1K–$2.5K/month. Minimum 3 months.”
- [ ] Add same or expanded line near final CTA strip (“Ready to see if we’re a fit?”).
- [ ] Include “depending on niche and external talent” (or approved variant) if space allows.
- [ ] Founder sign-off on final wording before publish.

---

## P3: Social proof (outcomes)

### R2 — TWIA case + promise
- [ ] Add “Results” or “Proof” section (e.g. after “Why a newsletter”).
- [ ] One card: **This Week in AI** — 0 to 25K subscribers in 12 months; global business owners; link to Substack.
- [ ] Copy emphasizes: growth, original research, content repurposing. No revenue or sales claims.
- [ ] Optional: add 1–2 more outcome cards later (same rules: no revenue/sales).
- [ ] Optional: one-line promise: “We deliver newsletters with original research you can repurpose for content marketing.”

---

## Design and QA

- [ ] All new copy matches brand voice (conviction, not hype).
- [ ] Mobile: hero, archetype, “plug in,” founder, and first CTA visible without excessive scroll.
- [ ] Links: TWIA, LinkedIn, X open correctly; no broken URLs.
- [ ] Footer: TWIA mention remains but is secondary to hero/strip.
- [ ] Final pass: founder sign-off on live copy and placement.

---

## Optional follow-ups (post–P3)

- [ ] Add founder headshot when asset is ready.
- [ ] Expand founder bio on `/about` and link from homepage.
- [ ] Add second/third outcome cards when more case studies are approved (growth/research/repurposing only).
